# Github-Finder

[**Click to see demo**](https://jsfiddle.net/yLmu5bo1/)

**Github-Finder** developed to learn *javascript*. So, this is not a professional project. There might be lots of errors. 

This project aims to fetch Github users data from Github API.

## Usage

You can set your own client id and client secret in the *Github.js* file. After that, just click to the *index.html* and **search** something.

## TODO List

 - [ ] Add some informations like favorite languages of user.
 - [ ] Add pagination to the repositories list.
 - [ ] Add charts
